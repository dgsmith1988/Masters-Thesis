We also show how the device can configure itself progressively, avoiding design calculations and allowing the device to stabilize itself against drifts in component properties and to continually adjust itself to changing conditions. This self-configuration operates by training with the desired pairs of orthogonal input and output functions, using sets of detectors and local feedback loops to set individual optical elements within the device, with no global feedback or multiparameter optimization required. Simple mappings, such as spatial mode conversions and polarization control, can be implemented using standard planar integrated optics. In the spirit of a universal machine, we show that other linear operations, including frequency and time mappings, as well as nonreciprocal operation, are possible in principle, even if very challenging in practice, thus proving there is at least one constructive design for any conceivable linear optical component; such a universal device can also be self-configuring. This approach is general for linear waves, and could be applied to microwaves, acoustics, and quantum mechanical superpositions.},

Compared to Vapnik's algorithm, however, ours is much simpler to implement, and much more efficient in terms of computation time. We also show that our algorithm can be efficiently used in very high dimensional spaces using kernel functions. We performed some experiments using our algorithm, and some variants of it, for classifying images of handwritten digits. The performance of our algorithm is close to, but not as good as, the performance of maximal-margin classifiers on the same problem, while saving significantly on computation time and programming effort.",

	abstract = {Universal multiport interferometers, which can be programmed to implement any linear transformation between multiple channels, are emerging as a powerful tool for both classical and quantum photonics. These interferometers are typically composed of a regular mesh of beam splitters and phase shifters, allowing for straightforward fabrication using integrated photonic architectures and ready scalability. The current, standard design for universal multiport interferometers is based on work by Reck et al. \[Phys. Rev. Lett.73, 58 (1994)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.73.58\]. We demonstrate a new design for universal multiport interferometers based on an alternative arrangement of beam splitters and phase shifters, which outperforms that by Reck et al. Our design requires half the optical depth of the Reck design and is significantly more robust to optical losses.},

The distribution of reflectivities required to implement an arbitrary unitary transformation is skewed towards low values, and this skew becomes stronger the larger the number of modes. A realistic implementation using Mach-Zehnder interferometers is incapable of achieving the low values required and thus has limited fidelity. We show that numerical optimisation and adding extra beam splitters to the network can help to restore fidelity.},

	abstract = {For the benefit of designing scalable, fault resistant optical neural networks (ONNs), we investigate the effects architectural designs have on the ONNs\&\#x02019; robustness to imprecise components. We train two ONNs \&\#x02013; one with a more tunable design (GridNet) and one with better fault tolerance (FFTNet) \&\#x02013; to classify handwritten digits. When simulated without any imperfections, GridNet yields a better accuracy (\&\#x0223C;98\&\#x00025;) than FFTNet (\&\#x0223C;95\&\#x00025;). However, under a small amount of error in their photonic components, the more fault tolerant FFTNet overtakes GridNet. We further provide thorough quantitative and qualitative analyses of ONNs\&\#x02019; sensitivity to varying levels and types of imprecisions. Our results offer guidelines for the principled design of fault-tolerant ONNs as well as a foundation for further research.},

	abstract = "In this paper, we present a general class of neural networks with discontinuous neuron activations and varying coefficients, where the neuron activation function is a discontinuous monotone increasing and bounded function. By using the fixed point theorem in differential inclusion theory and constructing suitable Lyapunov functions, a condition is derived which ensures the existence and global exponential stability of a unique periodic solution for the neural network. Furthermore, under certain conditions global convergence in finite time of the state is investigated. The obtained results show that Forti’s conjecture for neural networks without delays is true. Finally, two numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the results obtained in this paper."
