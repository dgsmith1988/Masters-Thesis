\chapter*{Abstract / Résumé}
\section*{English}
This thesis introduces a digital waveguide model for simulating the sound of a slide guitar. This model uses a single digital waveguide model for the transverse vibrations of the string as well as an additional module which models the contact sound between the slide and string surfaces. After introducing the background and previous inspiration model, a more well developed architecture is defined and introduced. Included in this is an examination of its limitations. This model was implemented in MATLAB and facilitates sound synthesis on a sample-by-sample computation. The verification techniques used in the development model are described. As this is a physical model, various measurements were made on an actual acoustic guitar in an attempt to verify the model's accuracy as well as refine aspects missing from previous attempts. After these measurements are made, the strategies used in parametrzing the model for sound design and musicality are discussed.
