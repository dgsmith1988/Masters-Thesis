\section{Future Work}
Interpolated look-up table for tuning phase delay.

Refine loop-filter to not go above 1 for frequency response.

Measure the different between fresh strings and older corroded strings and the impact it has on the sound and coupling (rusted unwound strings might have longitudinal mode stimulation).

Devise measurement method to capture the contact sound generated by the wound strings. Use a harder foam to mute the transverse vibrations?

Add more control over the dynamics of the plucked sound
