# Measurement and Design of a Digital Waveguide Slide Guitar Synthesizer
This is a repo for the software and data which I developed during the course of my Master's Thesis. If you are a fan of audio DSP and slide guitar, then *boy howdy* did you come to the right place! (That last sentence should be read using a Southern drawl). The contents of the repo includes:

 - All the code, data and measurements used to develop the model and verify the results
 - The thesis itself in PDF format
 - The LaTeX version of the document to help serve as a template for other Music Tech students
 - Documentation in the form of class diagrams and signal-flow charts to help understand the algorithms
 - The generated and recorded sound examples (referred to throughout the thesis)
 - The various papers referred to in the thesis

Please keep in mind that this was developed as a research project where the functionality wasn't well defined at the outset and developed as the project progressed. Accordingly, there are areas where strict adherence to "proper" software engineering ideaologies are not followed. Generally, this is to facilitate the exploration of the functionality as the priority was more on results as compared to architectural perfection. Sometimes this was also done to help increase efficiency of the computations. An example of this would be how certain member variables are public and modified by external classes instead of using a getter() or setter() function.
